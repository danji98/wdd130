            <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hi there, my name is Daniel Vargas" width="200">
            <p>Hi there, I'm Daniel Vargas. I was born in Venezuela, grew up there and served a mission on the east (Venezuela, Barcelona Mission) in the country from 2017 through 2019. My family moved to Ecuador during the half of my service, they came to Machala in 2018 looking for better opportunities due to the social political situation of Venezuela. Since I returned in August 2019, I've been participating in Church's educational programs. I just have to say that Pathway Connect has been an immense blessing in my life until this day. I'm pursuing a career as a Software Developer and a Web Designer, and want to impact in the world somehow. I've got some ideas about how I will do it, and to achieve that goal, I need to become the best developer I can be. So I will give my best throughout all the career. Something curious about me? I like to talk about mental health and the impact it has on people. I suffered from depression for a long time, and I know how hard is for someone that suffers from it to keep going. I love to help people realize how valuable they are and how much God cares for them. I just love to serve.</p>

            <h2>Maracaibo</h2>
            <p>Maracaibo is a tropical city located in the east of Venezuela, just next to Colombia. It is known for its consistently warm climate, making it one of the hottest cities in the world, reaching temperatures of almost 50 C°. <br><br>
                One of the city's most remarkable natural attractions is the "Catatumbo lightning," a unique weather phenomenon where lightning strikes occur almost nightly, creating a spectacular display in the night sky. <br><br>
                Economically, Maracaibo plays a significant role in Venezuela, primarily due to its strategic location as a major port on Lake Maracaibo. <br><br>
                The city is a hub for oil-related industries, with several oil refineries and petrochemical plants in the area. This makes it a vital contributor to Venezuela's oil production and export.</p>
